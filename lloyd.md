The author's methodology uses specific data sets from space satellites to focus on specific areas around the globe. This type of Geographical Information System (GIS) uses topography data and country boundary data. This also helps the researchers look at human population data. Data from GADM, HDX, and mostly from the WorldPop Archive helped represent most of the data distribution. The geospatial data sets are from Viewfinder Panoramas, country IDs, country area, and slope. Using Lloyd et al.'s method was important when being more precise with their datasets.

Compared to a conventional census, their data is more specific, refined, and has a clearer base scale/disaggregation levels. Scale refers to how close the map is, like 100m or 30r = 1km. They were then able to have a higher resolution. Disaggregation allowed them to take specific pieces from a data set, which was necessary because of the large scale. Conventional census also doesn't produce results as accurately as the grid population data.

The authors use different geospatial layers with data science to produce a higher resolution and a globarl gridded description of human populations. This information can be used to detect human clustering (population densities), look at human reactions to weather (Michael Lewis's "The Fifth Risk"), poverty, human movements, etc. all updated regularly because of satellite imagery.

NOTES:
scale = size of the project wants to figure out a way to zoom in on maps (ex: 100m, 30arc)
disaggregation = taking pieces of a data set (infers that it's a big sample/population, large scale)
administrative area = a specific area, to look at geoboundaries, country borders, HDX and GADM
rasters/grid cells = the resolution, produced using satellite imagery from space
uniform distribution = equal distribution, each is evenly spaced apart
proportionate allocation = (dasymetric)
